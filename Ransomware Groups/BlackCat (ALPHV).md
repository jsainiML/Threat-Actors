## Threat Actor: BlackCat (ALPHV) üêà‚Äç‚¨õ
BlackCat, also known as ALPHV or Noberus, is a sophisticated ransomware group that emerged in November 2021. Operating under a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, BlackCat is notable for being the first widely known ransomware family written in the Rust programming language, which enhances its performance and cross-platform capabilities. 

The group has targeted numerous organizations worldwide across various sectors, including healthcare, education, and critical infrastructure. Their attacks often involve double extortion tactics, where data is both encrypted and exfiltrated, with threats to publish the stolen data to pressure victims into paying ransoms. 

Law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of State, have intensified efforts against BlackCat, offering rewards for information leading to the identification or location of its leaders. Despite these efforts, BlackCat remains a persistent threat in the cybersecurity landscape.
